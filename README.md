- If you are wondering what this will be, welcome aboard! All I can say is that there will be an inverse relationship between me doing stupid python things over and over again and the code in this repo. Feel free to ask me why I put something in here - you may find my response trivial, lacking in detail, or, perhaps, a rare stroke of genius. Stay tuned

### Use
- For linux/mac
```
bash install.sh
```
```
source ~/.bash_rc
```

### Notes
- Remember to source you .bashrc/.bash_profile file after you run install.sh!
